            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Centralized Version Control Systems for many years, has been the standard for version control. With the one major reason being how convenient it’s for people that need to collaborate with developers on other systems. You also can see the work as the other team member move along and if you have an administrator they can control who can work on what. Some examples of Centralized Version Control Systems have a single server that stores all the versioned files from the multiple clients that check out files from the central place. A down fall of this being a centralized version control system is that since it’s centralized if the central database become corrupt you run the risk of losing everything.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a system that record changes to a set of files over time so you can go back and look at the different versions. Version control is really good for groups working on a single project from different location because it allows each user to access the file but won’t allow the users to save over what someone else has did. Version control save multiple version allowing the user to compare the different versions if they come into a problem to see what part of the process the problem came . Once one developer checks out a file, others can read that file, but no one else may change that file until that developer checks in the updated version.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> Git is a version control system but Git think about the data in a different way than the other version control system. Git thinks of its data more like a set of snapshots of a miniature filesystem. Every time you commit, or save the state of your project in Git, it takes a snapshot of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot. Awareness is provided by Git too being that Git is aware of all changes to the files or directory thanks to it being check summed. Nearly all of the actions in Git only add data to the Git database.

                <span class="text-muted">The Three States</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The three main states of Git that a file will reside is committed, modified, and staged. In the committed state the data is safely stored in your local database. Modified means that you have changed the file but have not stored it in the database yet. Somes files are pulled out of the compressed database in the Git directory and placed on disk for you to use or modify.  The modified file is in the working directory, where it's a single checkout of one version of the project. Staged means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Distributed Version Control</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Distributed Version Control is a version control that create a copy of the file for each client that is checking out the files or for editing the file so they can store them on the local database. This is lowering the chances of project spiraling out of control because of the central database being corrupted and the users losing everything. If any server dies, communicating through it, any of the client repositories can be copied back up to the server to restore it. deal pretty well with collaborating with different groups of people in different ways simultaneously within the same project.</p>
